A blushing bride
A fool and his money
Absence makes the heart grow fonder
Acid test
Add insult to injury
Age before beauty
All in all
All is not gold that glitters
All things being equal
All work and no play
Apple pie order
As luck would have it
At one fell swoop
Barking up the wrong tree
Best laid plans
Better late than never
Better mind your ps and qs
Beyond the pale
Blood is thicker than water
Blow off steam
Born with a silver spoon
Breathe a sigh of relief
Bright and early
Bring home the bacon
Budding genius
Busy as a bee
Butterflies in (my) stomach
Caught red-handed
Checkered career
Cherchez la femme
Chip off the old block
Clear as mud
Cold feet
Cold sweat
Cool as a cucumber
Dead as a doornail
Dead give away
Deaf as a post
Depths
Die is cast
Dog days
Draw the line
Drink and be merry
Drunk as a skunk
Dull thud
Ear to the ground
Eat
Eat (my) hat
Face the music
Far cry
Feather in (his
Gentle as a lamb
Get the upper hand
Get up on the wrong side of the bed
Gild the lily
Grain of salt
Green as grass
Green with envy
Hale and hardy
Hand to mouth
Happy as a lark
Hard row to hoe
Head over heels
Heart of gold
High on the hog
Hungry as a bear
If truth be told
In the final analysis
In the long run
It goes without saying
It is the last straw
It stands to reason
Kettle of fish
Last but not least
Lean over backward
Leave in the lurch
Left-handed compliment
Let thew cat out of the bag
Like a bolt out of the blue
Limp as a rag
Little did I think
Lock
Mad as a wet hen
Mad dash
Make ends meet
Make hay when the sun shines
Make no bones
Meets the eye
Method in his
Naked truth
Necessary evil
Never a dull moment
Nipped in the bud
Not to be sneezed at
Of despair
On the ball
Open and shut
Opportunity knocks
Out of sight out of mind
Over a barrel
Pay the piper
Pretty as a picture
Pull his
Raining cats and dogs
Read someone the riot act
Red as a beet
Right down (my) alley
Ring true
Rub someone the wrong way
Sad but true
Save it for a rainy day
Self made man
Sell like hot cakes
Seventh heaven
Sick and tired
Sight to behold
Sing like a bird
Snare and a delusion
Sow wild oats
Start the ball rolling
Steal thunder from someone
Stir up a hornet nest
Stock and barrel
Strong as an ox
Stubborn as a mule
Stuffed shirt
Terra firma
The bitter end
The jog is up
Throw the book at
Tit for tat
Too funny for words
Turn over a new leaf
Waiting with bated breath
Wee small hours
Without further ado
Wolf in sheep clothing
Wrack my brains
You can say that again
Your guess is as good as mine
